## 2025-05-23 - Dark Mode for Redirect Pages
**Learning:** Even ephemeral pages like redirects benefit significantly from dark mode support. A bright white screen during a redirect can be jarring ("flashbang" effect) for users with dark mode preferences, especially in low-light environments.
**Action:** Always include `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` in global styles or inline CSS for maintenance pages, 404s, and redirects to ensure a seamless visual transition.
